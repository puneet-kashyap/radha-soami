                            <h3>Radha Soami</h3>
                            <p>Radhasoami (Radha Swami) is a spiritual movement that originated in 19th century India, and is considered by adherents as a true way to attain God realization.</p>
                            <p>The word "Radhasoami" itself is actually a combination of two words: "Radha" (referring to the soul or spiritual essence, either of an individual or of the whole) and "Soami" (referring to the spiritual master; cognate to the Sanskrit term swami or svami); the combined word thus refers to the "Lord of the Soul" or God.</p>
                            <p>It also can be interpreted to mean the "Master Soul" or "Spirit Master" who guides the disciple to higher states of consciousness. Like Sant Mat sects, Radhasoami emphasizes the use of listening to inner sound accessed by (mantra/simran), combined with personal loyalty to a given living Master, for devotees to attain desired states of spiritual advancement.</p>
                            <h3>Why RadhaSoami.ca ?</h3>
                            <p>One of the challenges encountered by many new people in Canada is that there are not much information available about where to go for Satsang on the weekends in their locality or where to meet the fellow Radha Soami sangat in Canada.</p>
                            <p>So, we at RadhaSoami.ca decided to serve this website as a Sewa to create the platform for Radha Soami community in Canada.</p>
                            <p>A very humble request to spread the word and assist all the people in Canada to find Satsang centres in their region or city and unite with other fellow Radha Soami sangat.</p>
                            <p>If you would like to share the location of your neighbourhood satsang house or phone number where they can get more info then please share the full address and the phone number <span className="glyphicon glyphicon-phone-alt"></span> at <a href="mailto:info@radhasoami.ca">info@radhasoami.ca</a> and we would love to publish it here so that our fellow satsangis can benefit and get in touch with our Radha Soami community in Canada.</p>
